Episode-1: Inception
Add the react into our project. 

1.	Using CDN (content delivery network)
```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```
Import above links into our index.html, and we can start using react functions.

Why react and react-dom is on different library?
React: - contains core react things.
React-dom: – browser related things and react can be used without browser as well.

To create a react element,
Const heading = React.createElement(“h1”, {}, “hello world from react!”)
•	Tag name
•	{} = attributes to the tag. Id, class … 
•	Content in the tag(innerhtml)
Heading => is a react element. Plain JS object.
Create ‘root’, where react can make all dom manipulations.
Const root = reactDom.createRoot(document.getElementbyId(“root”)) // root is the already available element in the dom.
Root.render(heading);
//takes the object and create the htmlelement and put on the DOM.

Create a nested structure.
React.createElement(“div”, {id: “parent”}, React.createElement(“div”, {id: “child”}, React.createElement(“h1”, {}, “I am h1 tag”)))

React can be used on portion of the page also.
